# WMFTmagnetization
Simple script to calculate magnetization using the Weiss mean field theory model and Kuzâ€™min equation of state

This script was developed to compare the WMFT and Kuz'min models. It was published as part of an ARL tech note (ARL-TN-1027). To test, simply run

> `$ python magnetization.py`

which should save the `Ni-magnetization.png` (as shown in Fig. 6b).
